# Linux on Huawei MateBook 13 (2020)

> Brain dump: MateBook 13 (Wright-W19) running Debian heavily inspired by [lidel's documentation of running Linux on MateBook X](https://github.com/lidel/linux-on-huawei-matebook-x-2017).

## Background

Huawei MateBook 13, released in 2019, has at least two modifications (different CPUs, integrated vs. dedicated graphics). Both come with Microsoft Windows 10 and there initially was no information at all concerning Linux support.

I am running Debian on the more simple MateBook 13 variant, model Wright-W19. This repository documents what works and what does not.

[Reportedly](https://github.com/nekr0z/linux-on-huawei-matebook-13-2019/issues/21), it also holds true for at least one 2020 Huawei Matebook 13 (AMD Ryzen 5 3500) running Elementary OS.
